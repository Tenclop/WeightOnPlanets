  ## About
  
  <p>
  Your mass is the same no matter what planet youâ€™re on, but your weight changes because gravity is different. 
  The reason gravity is different is because other planets have different masses and diameters from Earth.
  To calculate your weight on another planet by multiplying your weight times the relative surface gravity of the other world.
  
  ```
Weight = Mass x Surface Gravity
  ```
